an elegant datasets factory


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://rawbuilder.readthedocs.io.



Features
=================

* Schema oriented datasets builder


How to Use it
=================
Terminal
::
    # Import the package into any python app
    import rawbuilder

    # Init the dataset object as ds
    ds = rawbuilder.DataSet(
            size=1000,
            tasks=['user']
    )

    # Build the dataset
    ds.build()

    # Get the schema location to edit with any IDE
    ds.schema_location()


Schema
=================
- The Schema is a JSON object that describes three main components.
- The *model names*, the *column names*, and the *data source* per column.
- Note the below code-block, The model name is "Student", and it contain 4 properties [id,first_name,email,math_test_results].
- Each property of the model "student" has its data source description.
- The builder will use all the information in the schema to build the required tasks or data sets.

Student data model example:
::
    "student": {
        "id": "int",
        "first_name": "first_name",
        "last_name": "last_name",
        "email": "email",
        "math_test_results": "random_int between,0,30"
    }


Data types to can use in the schema
********
- int: build a list of integers between 1 and requested dataset size.
- decrement: build a list of decremented integers between the requested size and 1.
- random_int: build a list of random integers between 0 and 100 by default.
- first_name: build a list of first names.
- last_name: build a list of last names.
- email: build a list of fake emails.

Data Modifiers
==============
Combine Data Modifiers to the above data types, it can adjust values, change the data nature, and gives more control over the final output.

Modifiers syntax is simple:
::
 "modifier,value_1,value_2,value_*"

Use the modifier *between* to generate random integer column between 0 and 30:*
::
 "math_test_results": "random_int between,0,30"

All Modifiers
***********

1) **between**
------------
Use this modifier to set the high-end and low-end for a specific data type.

Syntax:
::
 "between,10,1000"

Supported with:
random_int:
::
 "math_test_results": "random_int between,0,30"
